Experience: total of two months experience casually writing go at Insightpool (automating system tasks). Some code review. Recently picked up again after 6month hiatus to do this project.
Problem: As a person living or visiting in San Francisco, I'd love to know where the closest, open food trucks are. I'd also enjoy the ability to sort by a variety of parameters (type)
Solution: Api first backend that allows the user to hit the following endpoints to accomplish the above tasks. Many different clients can access the ability to view all food trucks in the default radius and from there query based off what makes sense as default or for user.

As I haven't provided a rich-front end experience from the user to use the app with, I focused on an api-first design where a developer more capable (or future me with more time) in front-end development can consume data by querying 4 simple endpoints.
Trade-offs:

Link to other code I'm proud of: some haskell stuff, but I really need to open source more.
